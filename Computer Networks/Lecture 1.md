- Some of this is on my desktop, it will be merged with this document later. this is a continuation from those notes


## Internet Architecture
- network of networks 
	- small number of well-connected large networks
		- "tier-1" commercial ISPs (such as Level 3, Spring, AT&T, etc.), which give national or international coverage
		- content provider network (such as Google), private network that connects its data centers to Internet, often by passing tier-1, regional ISPs


## Internet
- Network service provider (NSP)
	- provides the backbone (WAN) connections over large geographical area





## Cloud Computing
- large format of servers, that are available to deliver services for customers 
- sometimes they give you free services to work with or sometimes some other software to work with as well
- sometimes you can build your own servers as they provide a platform
- 'hardware on the cloud' instead of owning hardware
- also gives networking capabilities to connect many servers together
	- can think of building networks within a cloud


## Network Security 
- many hackers try to steal information from your machine
- sometimes will not allow you to run your business
- they can put malware into your computer using the Internet 
	- virus: self-replicating infection by receiving/executing object (e.x. an email attachment)
	- worm: self-replicating infection by passively receiving object that can execute itself
- sometimes they may use your computer as a bot in a botnet 
- infected host can be enrolled in a botnet, and then used for spam

- it is also possible for attackers to get your data
- especially on a public network
- if you send your data to your server, or even through the internet, there is a chance of it getting intercepted which leads to the hacker getting your information


- ID Spoofing 
	- send packet with false source address
	- they use fake addresses, in order to fool the people who track this traffic
	- they don't use their own IP or mac addresses


## Wireless Networks
- they use WiFi, which is the IEEE802.11 network
- they use the ISM bands
	- they are reserved for free use
	- 902-928 MHz
	- 2.4-2.5GHz
	- and one more 
	- these are the frequencies that we can use for free

- signals in the ISM band vary in strength 
	- sometimes because of multipath fading because of reflections
- when you can't get a wifi signal, that usually  means that all the signals are bouncing off each other
	- if you  move a little bit and get a better signal, that means that the signal got better
- the longer the distance, the worse the signal 
	- this distance where you are still able to get a strong signal is called a 'radius' or 'range'

## RFID and Sensor Networks
- passive UHF RFID networks every objects
	- tags are placed on objects
	- they generate a small electric force in that tage 
	- when something comes into that force (fixing a circuit) it sends the tag id to the reader, so they can communicate
	- this means that you can share information by tapping two objects together (for example, tap-to-pay)
- Sensor networks:
	- communicate with other devices as well


## Metric Units 
- the power of 10 when talking about rates 
	- 1 Mbps = 1,000,000 bps 
- use powers of 2 for storage 
	- 1 KB
