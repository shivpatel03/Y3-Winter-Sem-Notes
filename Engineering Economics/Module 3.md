# Accounting

# The role of accounting
- engineering econ focuses on financial aspects of projects
- accounting focuses on financial aspects of firms
- Three functions within a business
	- engineering econ: analyze the impact of alternatives and projects
	- accounting: determine the monetary impact of past decisions, report on the financial aspect of the firm, and evaluate potential sources that can fund the business
	- management: allocate resources to projects (monetary resources), evaluate performance, selects and tells other employees what to work on
- accounting for business transactions
	- involves two parties:
		- also involves exchange of dollars for a product or service
	- accounting functions:
		- record, analyze, and report on transactions
		- summarize financial data
		- provide data for accounting and cost accounting
			- can be used in the future for other reasons (for checking the value of the business for example)

# Primary Accounting statements
- balance sheet:
	- a firm's financial condition at a given time
	- lists a firm's assets, liabilities, and equity
- income statement
	- firm's performance over a period of time


# The balance sheet
![[Pasted image 20240205182546.png]]
## Terminology from this image:
- Assets: things that are owned by the firm and have some monetary value
- Liabilities: dollar claims against the firm
	- short term: due within one year
	- long term: longer due dates (mortgages, bonds, loans, etc.)
- Equity (also known as net worth): represents funding from the firm and its owners
- Fundamental accounting equations
	- assets = liabilities + equity

- for the company in question (Engineered Industries)
	- total assets are 13,815,000
	- total liabilities (including current and long-term) are 3,380,000
	- total equity is $10,435,000
- fundamental equation for accounting:
	- assets = liability + equity
- working capital
	- working capital = current assets - current liabilities

- financial ratios from the balance sheet
	- the financial health of the firm can be determined through a ratio of quantities
	- `current ratio = current assets/current liabilities`
		- shows the ability of the firm to cover the current liabilities
		- firms have aimed to be at 2.0 or above
	- acid-test ratio (a.k.a. quick ratio) = quick assets/total current liabilities
		- shows ability of the firm to pay debt quickly
		- quick assets do not include current inventories because of the time it takes to sell the inventory
		- must be above 1
- financial ratios from the balance sheet above:
	- `current ratio = 8,770,000 / 2,180,000 = 4.02`
		- above 2, good 
	- `acid-test ratio = ([1,940,000 + 950,000 + 4,100,000]/2,180,000 = 3.21)`
		- well above 1, good

# The Income Statement
- known as profit and loss statement
- summarizes revenues and expenses over a given period of time
- used to check revenue and expenses that occur between the time that balance sheets are made
- income statement reports the firm's net income (profit) or loss by doing:
	- `revenues - expensses = net profiit (loss)`
	- if this is positive, means profit was made
	- if this is negative, means a loss happened
![[Pasted image 20240205222653.png]]
## Terminology from this image
- Total revenues = $18,350,000
- Total expenses = $17,230,000
	- not sure how they got these numbers from this sheet CHECK LATER
- net income = revenues - expenses
	- = 1,120,000 before taxes
	- = 730,000 after taxes

- financial ratios from income statement
	- net profit ratio = net profit/net sales revenue
		- shows cost efficiency within the firm
		- shows ability to convert sales into profit 
		- net sales revenue equals sales minus returns and allowances
	- interest coverage ratio = total income/interest payments
		- shows how much revenue must drop to affect ability to pay debts
		- should be at least 3 for big firms
		- that income is total revenues minus all expenses except interest payments

- from this income statement
	- net profit ratio
		- 730,000/18,030,000 = 0.040 = 4%
	- interest coverage ratio = total income/interest payments
		- (18,350,000 - 17,110,000)/120,000 = 10.3

- linking the balance sheet, income statement, capital transactions
	- there are many links between these three pages that help make business transactions
	- for analysis:
		- overall profit or loss and the starting and ending equity
		- acquisition of capital assets
		- depreciation of capital assets
		- the overall profit or loss shown in a year (from income statement), shown in change in retained earnings (RE) between balance sheets at the start and end of the year
		- to find the change in RE, subtract any dividends distributed to owners and add value of any new capital stock sold
		- change in RE
			-  `RE_end = RE_beginning = Net income(or loss) + new stock - dividends`


# Traditional Cost Accounting 
- Cost accounting: used to develop the cost of products
	- determine mix of labor, materials, and other costs used in production
	- evaluate outsourcing and subcontracting possibilities
all of these factors lead to the cost of the product:
![[Pasted image 20240205224211.png]]

- direct and indirect costs
	- costs incurred to produce a product or service or traditionally direct or indirect
	- direct costs: costs that are directly associated to final product/service
	- indirect costs: costs that are not easily linked to product or services
		- example: machine depreciation, management/sales/admin costs/etc.

- Indirect cost allocation
	- indirect costs are sometimes allocated across projects through "absorption costing"
	- allocating overhead costs based on factors, such s
		- number of direct labor costs each project has
		- direct label hours
		- direct material cost
		- total direct cost

- problems with traditional cost accounting
	- indirect costs can distort product costs and the decisions based on those costs
	- some firms are shifting to activity-based costing (ABC), where activities are linked to specific cost drivers and in this way overhead is potentially minimized

# Other problems to look out for
- centralized accounting systems are accused by project manager to be "too slow" or "untimely"
- if an organization has many files and systems for stakeholders to see, the level of accuracy in one or all systems may be low
	- analysts that make cost estimates might have to use other information to make a decision
- inventory or land values may be written at a lower cost
	- this is because it is based on acquisition cost
- capital equipment being valued too high or too low depending on the depreciation methods and company policy
