# Example of uninformed search
- on holiday in Romania; currently staying in Arad
- flight leaves tomorrow from Bucharest
	- we want to formulate a goal
		- goal is to be in Bucharest
	- formulate the problem
		- states: various cities
		- actions: drive between cities
	- find a solution: 
		- a sequence of cities to get to Bucharest

# Problem Types 
- deterministic, fully observable -> single state problem
	- agent knows what state it will be in
	- solution is a sequence
- non-observable -> conformant problem
	- agent may have no idea where it is
	- solution (if any) is a sequence
- nondeterministic and/or partially observable -> contingency problem
