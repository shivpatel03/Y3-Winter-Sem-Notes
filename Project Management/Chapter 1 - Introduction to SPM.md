# Why is project management important?
- lots of money is spent on Information and communications technology (ICT).
	- the UK government spent 2.3 billion euros on contracts for ICT and only 1.4 billion on road buildings
- projects often fail
- poor project management is a very big reason for these failures

# What is a project? 
- 'specific plan or design'
- 'a planned undertaking'
- 'a large undertaking e.g. a public works scheme'


# Jobs vs Projects
- 'Jobs' - repetition of very well-defined and well understood tasks with little uncertainty
- 'Exploration' - example: finding the cure for cancer, the outcome is very uncertain
- Projects are somewhat in between both of these

# Characteristics of projects 
- A task is more 'project-like' if it is:
	- non-routine
	- planned
	- aimed at a specific target
	- carried out for a customer
	- carried out by a temporary work group
	- involving several specialisms
	- made up of several phases
	- constrained by time and resources
	- large and/or complex

# Are Software projects really different from other projects? 
- not really, but
- invisibility
- complexity
- conformity: compliance with standards, rules, or laws
- flexibility


# Contract management vs. technical project management 
- projects can be: 
	- in-house: clients and developers are employed by the same organization
- out-sourced:
	- clients and developers employed by different organizations
- 'project manager' could be
	- a contract manager in the client organization
	- a technical project manager in the supplier/services organization

# Activities covered by project management 
- Feasibility study:
	- is project technically feasible and worthwhile from a business point of view?
- Planning
	- only done if project is feasible
- Execution
	- implement plan, but plan may change as we go along


# ISO 12207 life-cycle 
- requirements analysis
	- requirements elicitation: what does the client need?
	- analysis: converting 'customer-facing' requirements into equivalents that developers can understand
	- requirements will cover
		- functions
		- quality
		- resource constraints i.e. costs
		- ![[img/Pasted image 20240108195713.png]]
- architecture design
	- based on system requirements
	- defines components of a system:  hardware, software, organizational
	- software requirements will come out of this
- Code and test:
	- coding and testing of individual components
- integration:
	- putting these individual components together
![[img/Pasted image 20240108195822.png]]

- qualification testing
	- testing the system (not just the software)
- installation:
	- process of making the system operational
	- includes setting up standing data, settings system parameters, installing on operational hardware platforms, user training, etc.
- Acceptance support
	- including maintenance and enhancement


# Some ways of categorization projects 
- distinguishing different types of project is important as different types of task need different project approaches. example: 
	- voluntary systems (such as computer games) versus compulsory systems, example: the order processing system in an organization
	- information systems vs embedded systems
	- objective-based vs. product-based

# Objective vs. Product Driven
- Is implementing a new pay-roll system an objective or product-driven project? 
- implementing a new iPhone app?
- Switching database from DB2 to Oracle? 

# Embedded Systems
- what is it? 
	- ATM software
	- car climate control
	- car ABS, Airbag and Cruise Control Systems
	- Operating systems?
	- hard disk drive control system

# Stakeholders
- people who have stake and/or interest in the project
- could be users/clients or developers/implementers
- could be
	- within project team
	- outside project team, but in same organization
	- outside both project team and organization
- different stakeholders may have different objectives - need to define a set of common project objectives


# Setting Objectives
- answering the question "what do we have to do to have a success?"
- need for project authority:
	- sets the project scope
	- allocates/approves costs
- could be one person - or a group
	- project board
	- project management board
	- steering committee

# Objectives
- the objective of a project can be defined by completing the statement: 'the project will be regarded as a success if...'
- Rather than like post-conditions for the project, focus on WHAT will be put in place, rather than HOW activities will be carried out

- Which one is a good objective? 
	- a new payroll application will be operational by April 4th
	- design and code a new payroll application 

## Objectives should be SMART
- S - specific, that is, concrete and well-defined
- M - measurable, satisfaction of the objective can be objectively judged
- A - achievable, it is within the power of the individual or group concerned to meet the target
- R - relevant, the objective must be relevant to the true purpose of the project
- T - time constrained, there is a defined point in time by which the objective should be achieved


- Example of SMART Objectives:
	- To implement the new application on time within the budget
	- To implement the new software application with the fewest possible software errors that might lead to operation failure
	- To design a system that is user-friendly 
	- To produce full documentation for a new system

## Goals/Sub-objectives 
- There are steps required to achieving the objective
- these can be defined by completing the sentence;
	- "To reach objective X, the following must be in place:"
	- "A...."
	- "B...."
	- "C...."
- usually a goal can be allocated to an individual
- they might have the capability of achieving the goal themselves but not the overall objective:
	- example: 
	- Overall objective: user satisfaction with software product
	- Analyst Goal: accurate requirements
	- Developer Goal: reliable software

## Measure of Effectiveness
- How do we know that the goal or objective has been achieved
	- By a practical test, that can be objectively assessed
		- for example: for user satisfaction with software product:
	- Repeat business - they buy further products from us
	- Number of complaints - if low, etc
	- these are all ways to see the goal or objective was achieved through obvious means


## The Business case
- Benefits of delivered project must outweigh the costs
- These costs include: 
	- development
	- operation
- And benefits include; 
	- Quantifiable benefits
	- non-quantifiable benefits
- These benefits must be higher than the costs

## Project Success/Failure
- assume a triangle with 3 sides, one of the sides is the scope of the deliverables, the other is time, and the last is cost
	- this can be thought of as the 'project triangle'
- if one of the things is lacking or not going well, then you can fix that by changing something from the other two corners
	- for example, let's say that you are running out of time on your project deliverable
		- you can choose to either lower the scope of the project or higher the cost 
	- lets say that the cost is getting too high
		- then you can lower the scope of the project and adjust the time
	- you can fix some of the problems that may arise in the project by adjusting the other two corners


## Other success Criteria
- these can relate to longer term, less directly tangible assets
	- improved skill and knowledge about something
	- creation of assets that can be used on future projects, such as software libraries
	- improved customer relationships that lead to better business over time

## What is management 
- involved the following: 
	- planning - deciding what is to be done 
	- organizing - making arrangements 
	- staffing - selecting the right people for the job 
	- directing - giving instructions
	- monitoring - checking on progress 
	- controlling - taking actions to remedy hold-ups 
	- innovating - coming up with solutions when problems come up 
	- representing - checking in with clients, users, developers and other stakeholders in the project


## Management Control 
- data is collected from the real world
- that ate is then processed, processed, and some of that data is processed yet again 
- this processed data is now information, and is used to make decisions and plans
	- however we also need the objectives in addition to the information to create a plan 
- these plans are then used to create models and later on implemented.
- these implementations are actions that are then sent back into the "real world"


- Data can be seen as the raw details: 
	- "6000 documents are processed at location X"
- Information - the data is processed to produce something that is meaningful and useful 
	- "productivity is 100 documents a day"
- Comparison with objectives/goals
	- "we will not meet target of processing all documents by 31st March"
- Modelling - working out the probable outcomes of various decisions 
	- "if we employ two more staff at location X, how quickly will the documents be processed"
- Implementation - carrying out the actions that have been decided
