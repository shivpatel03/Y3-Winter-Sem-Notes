# Key Terms and Concepts 
- solutions: sequence of actions 
- search tree: 
	- good question: why search tree and not search graph? 
		- we turn every problem into a tree because it does not have any cycles
			- this makes it generally easier to find a solution more efficiently
	- a search tree:
		- root = initial state
		- branch (edges) = actions
		- nodes = states
