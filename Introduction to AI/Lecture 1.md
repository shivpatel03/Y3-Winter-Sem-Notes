# Problems to be Solved by Computers
- Easy
	- arithmetic
	- sorting lists of numbers
- solved after a lot of effort
	- playing simple board games
	- playing chess
	- recognizing faces in pictures
	- usable automated translation
	- playing Go
	- usable real-time translation of spoken words
- Real progress (not solved yet)
	- driverless cars
	- automatically providing captions for pictures
	- understanding story and answering questions about it
	- human level automation translation
	- interpreting what is going on in a photograph
- Nowhere near solved
	- writing interesting stories
	- interpreting a work of art
	- human-level general intelligence

- The history of AI is entangled with the history of computers


# What is AI
- Symbolic AI - tries to emulate consciousness
- Machine AI and everything else are non-symbolic AI
	- most of the material in this course is non-symbolic AI
- one of the biggest problems is in 'large language models' is 'hallucination', and they are a symbolic AI
	- this does not happen with non-symbolic AI

- systems that think like humans
- systems that think rationally
- systems that act like humans
- systems that act rationally

- suppose we have two dimensions of AI
	- the other is whether they think or act
	- one of them is whether they think/act rationally or more like humans
- the combination of these dimensions results in the four systems above
