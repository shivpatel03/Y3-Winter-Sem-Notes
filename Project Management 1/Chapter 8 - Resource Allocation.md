# schedules
- indicating start and completion dates for each activity
- resource schedule - indicating dates when resources are needed + level of resources
- cost schedule - shows accumulative expenditure

# resources
- labor, equipment, materials, space, services, time, money?

# money
- means by which one resource can be converted into another
- sometimes it is not the limiting factor, if you get some new software and it takes time for the team to get accustomed to it, that is something money can't buy

# resource allocation 
- resource requirement list - identify resources that are needed for each activity
- resource types
- resource histogram - allocate resource types to activities and examine

# scheduling resources
- after having the resource requirements list, the next stage is to map this on the activity plan
- represent activity plan as bar chart, and then produce resource histogram for each resource


- sometimes you will notice that you need more resources (manpower) than your team can offer
- this is when you have to smoothen out the chart. you can do this a few ways
	- by extending the time of the activity to spread out the timings. this will require an even amount of resources throughout the activity


# resource clashes
- there might be someone on the team that that needs to be in two place at the same time 
	- in two activities
- this means that they must find an activity to prioritize first, and delay the other one

# prioritizing activities
- resources have to be allocated to a project on the activity-by-activity basis
- finding best allocation is hard
- as soon as team member is allocated, the activity requires a scheduled start and finish date and the team member will become unavailable for that period of time
- two ways: 
	- total float priority - those with the smallest float have a highest priority
	- ordered list priority - takes into account duration of activity as well as float

# Burman's priority list
- gives priority to
	- shortest critical activities
	- other critical activities
	- shortest non-critical activities
	- non-critical activities with least float
	- non-critical activities


# resource usage 
- need to minimize the idle period of resources between tasks
- need to balance costs against early competition date

# allocating individuals to activities
- initial resource types for a task have to be replaced by individuals
- factors: 
	- availability, criticality, risk, training, team building, and motivation

## availability
- who is free? will change during course of project, because some tasks are completed earlier than planned

## criticality
- you would put your more experienced people into critical activities

## risk
- similar to criticality, but some activities could be off the critical path but have risks

## training 
- despite concerns about minimizing risk, it is okay to take some risks in order to develop the capability of staff

## team building 
- identifying people who work well together. even though changing stuff throughout the life of the project is more efficient, it is annoying as a team-member

# cost schedules
- costs include: staff costs, overheads, usage charges

- staff costs
	- includes salary, social security contributions, holiday pay, etc.
- overheads
	- space rental, service charges, etc.
	- some overheads could be directly linked to the project, and in other cases, you can include them in project costs
- usage charges
	- some charges can be made on a "pay as you go" basis
		- example: phone charges, postage, car mileage

# cost profile 
- shows how much is going to be spent in each week
- important for companies that allocate project budgets by financial year or quarter andt he project straddles more than these financial periods

# accumulative costs
- this is will be used to see if the project met cost targets

# balancing concerns 
- a good project is not simple
- because of the linking between different concerns, projects planning will need to be iterative. The consequence of decisions will need to carefully assessed and plans adjusted accordingly
