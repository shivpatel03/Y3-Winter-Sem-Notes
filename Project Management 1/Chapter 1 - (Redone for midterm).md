Will cover: 
- What is software project management, how is it different to normal project management?
- How do you know a project has been successful?
	- does the expectations of the stakeholders match that of the developers?


# Why is project management important?
- a lot of money is spent on information and communication technology
- projects fail often
	- poor project is a major factor of why these failures happen

# What is a project? 
- "specific plan or design"
- "planned undertaking"
- "a large undertaking, such as a public works scheme"
- Key points above are planning and size of a task

# Jobs vs Projects 
- jobs: repetition of very well-defined and understood tasks with little uncertainty
- exploration: finding the cure for cancer: the outcome is very uncertain
- projects are in the middle of these two


# Characteristics of Projects
- ask is more "project-like" if:
	- non-routine
	- planned
	- aimed at target
	- large and/or complex
	- and more

# Are Software projects different from other projects? 
- not exactly but there are some key differences:
	- invisibility
	- complexity
	- conformity
	- flexibility

# Contract management vs. technical project management
- projects can be one of these two:
	- in house: developers and clients employed by same organization
	- out sourced: developers and clients employed by different organizations
- project manager could be:
	- "contract manager" in client organization
	- "technical project manager" in the supplier/service organization

# Activities done in project management
- Feasibility study:
	- is this project technically feasible and worth pouring money into?
- Planning study:
	- only done if project is feasible
- Execution:
	- create and implement a plan, but plan may change as time goes on

# Software Development Life Cycle 

## Requirements Analysis
- requirements elicitation: what does the client need? 
- analysis: converting "customer-facing" requirements to things that developers can understand
- requirements cover:
	- functions
	- quality
	- resource constraints (such as costs)
## Architecture Design 
- based on system requirements
- defines components of system: hardware, software, organizational
- software requirements will come out of this
## Code and Test 
- of individual components
## Integration
- putting components together
## Quality Testing 
- testing the system (not the software)
## Installation
- making the system operational
- including setting up standing data, setting system parameters, installing operational hardware, developing user training, etc.
## Acceptance Testing
- Includes maintenance and enhancement

# Plans, methods, and methodologies
- methodology = set of methods (or a way of working)
- these methodologies + context will lead to a plan
	- this plan includes start/end dates for each activity, staffing, tools, and materials, etc.

# Ways of Categorizing Projects 
- there are different types in projects, and distinguishing them is very important, because different tasks need different project approaches
- Voluntary systems: (computer games), vs. Compulsory systems (order processing system in organization)
- information systems vs. embedded systems
- objective-based versus product-based

# Objective vs. Product Driven
- is implementing a new payroll system an objective or project-driven project?
- what about implementing a new iPhone app?

# What an embedded system? 
- ATM software
- car climate control
- car ABS, airbag, cruise control
- OS
- Hard disk drive control system 

# Stakeholders
- people with stake/interest in project
- could be users/clients developers/implementers
- could be: 
	- within project team
	- outside project team but same organization
	- outside both project team team and organization
- different stakeholders have different objectives
	- need to define common project objectives

# Setting Objectives
 - answering: "What do we have to do to have success?"
 - need for project authority:
	 - sets project scope
	 - allocates/approves costs
 - one person
	 - project board
	 - project management board
	 - steering committee
# Objectives 
- informally, objective of a project can be defined by completing the statement:
	- `the project is regarded a success if ...`
- focus on what will be put into place, rather than how activities can be carried out

- which one is a better objective? 
	- a new payroll application will be operational by April 4th 
	- design and code a new payroll application

# Objectives should be SMART 
- S - Specific (well defined)
- M - measurable (satisfaction can be judged)
- A - achievable (within the power of the group who is working on meeting the target)
- R - relevant (must be relevant to the true purpose of the project)
- T - time constraint (defined point in time that objective should be done by)

# Goals/Sub-Objectives
- steps to achieving goals 
- defined by completing the sentence:
```
to reach objective X, the following must be in place`
A______
B______
C______, etc.
```

- often a goal can be allocated to an individual
- might have the capability of achieving goal on their own
- overall objective: user satisfaction with product
- analyst goal: accurate requirements
- developer goal: reliable software

# Measures of Effectiveness
- how do we know if objective has been achieved
- through practical test: objectively assessed
	- checking for user satisfaction with software product
- repeat business - they buy further products from us 
- number of complaints - if low etc.

# The business case
- benefits of delivered project must be higher than the cost 
- costs include:
	- development costs
	- operation costs
- benefits: 
	- quantifiable
	- non-quantifiable

# Project success/failure
- degree to which objectives are met
- ![[Pasted image 20240220130702.png]]
- you can adjust one of these three sides of the triangle
	- example: if project running out of time
		- increase cost
		- or reduce scope
	- known as the "project triangle"


# Other success criteria 
- relate to longer term, less directly tangible assets
- improved skill and knowledge
- creation of assets that can be used on future projects (example: software libraries)
- improved customer relationship that leads to more business

# What is management?
- involves:
	- planning: deciding what needs to be done
	- organizing: making arrangements
	- staffing: getting right people for the job
	- directing: giving instructions 
	- monitoring: checking on progress
	- controlling: coming up with solutions when problems emerge
	- representing - representing company with other clients, users, developers and stakeholders
# Management Control 
- Data - the raw details
	- example: 6000 documents processed at location X
- Information: data processes to get something useful/meaningful
	- example: productivity is 100 documents a day
- comparison with objectives/goals 
	- we will not meet target of processing all documents by 31st March
- modelling: working with probable outcomes of various decisions
	- example: if we employ two or more staff at location X how quickly can we get documents processed?
- implementation: carrying out the remedial actions that have been decided upon.

# Key Points 
- projects non-routine (uncertain)
- particular problems in projects example: lack of visibility
- clear objectives to objectively assess a project
- things happen (things are not always going to go as planned, needs control)
- communicate
-
