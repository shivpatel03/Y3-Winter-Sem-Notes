# Selection of Project Approaches 
- choosing right approach to particular project
	- called technical planning, project analysis, method engineering, methods tailoring
- in house: the methods to be used are dictated by organizational standards
	- developers and clients belong to same organization
- suppliers: need for tailoring as different customers have different needs

# Build or Buy? 
- in-house development means you build 
- outsourcing means you can either build or buy

# Advantages of Off-the-shelf (OTF) software
- cheaper, supplier can spread development costs over large number of customers
- software already exists
	- no delay while being developed
	- can be trialed by potential customer
- when there have been previous users of this software, most bugs and issues have been seen by them and have been fixed

# Disadvantages of OTF Software
- customers that have the same application don't have an advantage in the market
	- however, the way that this software is to be used also can give an advantage 
- customer may need to change the way that they work in order to fit in with the OTF software
- customer does not own the code to change anything if needed
- dangers of over-reliance on a single supplier

# Choosing Technologies
- outcome of project analysis is the appropriate selection of most appropriate methodologies and technologies
	- methodologies include technologies like OO dev.
	- structured systems and design methodology (SSADM) - set of standards for systems analysis and application design
- while technologies include mobile dev use knowledge-bae system tools

# Analysis Other Project Characteristic
- Some questions to ask before starting with a project
	- is it data-oriented or control oriented system?
	- is the software that is going to be produced going to be a general package or application specific?
	- is the system safety-critical?
	- what is the nature of the hardware/software environment in which the system will operate?

# General Approach
- Look at risks and uncertainties
	- are requirements well understood?
	- are technologies to be used well understood?
- look at the type of application being built
	- information system? embedded system?
- client's own requirements
	- need to use a particular method
