# acquiring software from external supplier
- could be
	- bespoke system - created for the customer
	- off-the-shelf - bought as is
	- customized off-the-shelf (COTS) - a core system is customized to meet the needs of a particular customer

# types of contracts 
- fixed price 
- time and material
- fixed price per delivered unit
- often, the license to use software is bought rather than the software itself

## fixed price contracts
- advantages to customer
	- known expenditure
	- supplier motivated to be cost-effective
- disadvantages
	- supplier will increase price when demand goes up 
	- hard to modify requirements
	- cost of changes likely to be higher
	- threat to system quality
- use when
	- you have clear requirements
	- small projects
	- limited budget
	- determined deadlines

## time and material contracts
- advantages to customer 
	- easy to change requirements
	- lack of price pressure can assist product quality
- disadvantages
	- low budgeting control
	- deep involvement
- the higher the price, the higher the cost per function point (higher the cost per material)

# fixed price/unit example 
- estimated system has 2600 function points
2000FPs x $967 plus
500FPs x $1019 plus
100FPs x $1058 = $2549300
- the first 2k FPs will have one value
- second 500 FPs will have some other value
- third 100 FPs will have another value
![[Pasted image 20240412143925.png]] using this table, the first 2k will have 967
the next amount only goes up to 2500, so the next 500 will have 1019
the only remaining amount is 100, so that will have a cost of 1058

## fixed price/unit 
- advantages to customer
	- customer has understanding of calculation of price
	- can compare between other schedules
	- emerging functionality can be accounted for 
	- supplier incentive to be cost-effective 
- disadvantages
	- difficult with size measurement - need independent FP counter
	- changing requirements is hard


# the tendering process 
- open tendering
	- lets say I wanted a software, I put out an invitation to Tender 
	- any supplier can respond to it with a tender
	- I must evaluate all tenders in the same way
- restricted tendering process
	- bids only from those specifically invited
	- can reduce suppliers being considered at any stage
- negotiated procedure
	- negotiate with one supplier e.g. for extensions to software already supplied

requirements analysis -> evaluation plan -> invitation to tender -> evaluation of proposals

# requirements document: sections
- introduction
- description of existing system and current environment
- future strategy or plans
- system requirements
	- mandator/desirable features
- deadlines
- additional information required from bidders

# requirements
- include
	- functions of software, inputs/outputs
	- standards to adhere to
	- other applications that it would be compatible with
	- quality requirements, example: response times

# evaluation plan
- how are proposals to be evaluated?
- method: 
	- reading
	- interviews
	- demonstrations
	- site views
	- practical tests
- need to access value for money for each feature
- value for money (VFM) approach is an improvement from the previous method, which was just taking the lowest bid
- example
	- feeder file saves data input
	- 4 hours work a month saved at $20/hour
	- system to be used for 4 years
	- if cost of feature is $1000, would it be worth it?
		- $4*20*12*4=3840$
		- 4 hours a month, at 20 bucks
		- times 12 times 4 because 4 years

# invitation to tender (ITT)
- bidder is making an offer in response to ITT (or request for proposal; RFP)
- acceptance of offer makes a contract
- customer may need further information

# memoranda of agreement (MoA)
- customer asks for technical proposal
- technical proposal are examined
- agreed technical solution in MoA
- tenders are then requested from suppliers based on MoA
- tenders judged on price
- fee could be paid for technical proposals by customer

# contracts
- project manager cannot be expected to be a legal expert, they need advice
- they must make sure that contract reflects the true requirements and expectations of supplier and client

# contract checklist 
- definitions
- form of agreement. is this a contract for a sale or a lease, or a license to use a software product? can the license be transferred?
- goods and services to be supplied - could have specifications
- timetable of activities
- payment arrangements
- ownership of software
	- can client sell software to others?
	- can supplier sell software to others? could specify that this customer has "exclusive use"
	- does supplier retain copyright?
	- where supplier retains source code, may be a problem if supplier goes out of business
- environment - example: where equipment is to be installed, who is responsible for various aspects of site preparation
- customer commitments - providing access, supplying information
- standards to be met

# contract management
- some terms on the contract will relate to the management of the contract,
	- progress reporting
	- decision points - could be linked to the release of payments to the contractor
	- variations to the contract, how are changes of requirements dealt with?
	- acceptance criteria
