- $\text{expected time given tasks=}(a + 4m + p)/6$
- $\text{standard deviation per task=}(b-a)/6$
- $\text{overall standard deviation S = }\sqrt{ \text{task SD's added and squared} }$
- $\text{overall standard deviation Z}=(\text{Target Time}-\text{Expected Time})/S$
	- use Z to find out the probability of the task finishing on target time

- planned value (PV): authorized budget to work with 
- earned value (EV): value of work performed expressed in terms of budget authorized for that work
- actual cost (AC): cost incurred for the work performed on an activity during a specific time period
- schedule variance = EV-PV
- schedule performance indicator = EV/PV
	- schedule variance < 0 or schedule performance indicator < 1.00 -> project is behind schedule

- cost variance (CV) = EV-AC
- cost performance indicator = EV/AC
	- cost variance>0 or cost performance indicator>1.00 -> project within budget

- estimate at completion = budget at completion / cost performance indicator
