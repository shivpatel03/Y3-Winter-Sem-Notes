# 2.1 Introduction
- sometimes managers justify a commitment to a single project because the benefits outweigh the cost of implementation
- in other cases, the project may not have some monetary gain
	- example: creating a system which allows for accurate recording of data
	- this system is very difficult to put a dollar value to
- chapter focuses on what a business case might have
- there are business cases for many projects, but there may be money or staff time for only some the projects
	- managers need a way to decide which project to select
	- called portfolio management
- this chapter will cover some of the ways that projects are evaluated and compared for inclusion in the project portfolio

# 2.2 A Business Case 
- many names, some companies call them "feasibility studies" or "project justification"
- objective is to provide a reason for the project 
	- done by showing that benefits of the project will be higher than the cost
	- cost includes development cost, implementation cost, operation cost
- business case document might contain:
	- introduction and background to the proposal
	- the proposed project
	- the market
	- organizational and operational infrastructure
	- benefits of the project
	- outline implementation plan
	- costs of the project
	- the financial case
	- risks that come with the project
	- management plan


## Introduction and Background 
- description of current environment and proposed project.
- the problem to solve or an opportunity to be exploited
	- these are included in this section

## The Proposed Market 
- outline of the market that this project is projected to


## The Market
- needed when project is to create a new product or new service capability
- contains information like estimated demand for product or service

## Organizational and Operational Infrastructure
- explains how the structure of the organization will be affected by implementing this project
- most relevant when project is changing something that is part a larger business case (a larger project)
- also relevant if tailored production or distribution system has to be setup when the new product is designed 

## Benefits 
- financial value should be assigned for the benefits if possible
- for commercial organizations, this can be related to increased profits (by increasing income or making savings on costs)
- for non-profit organizations, benefits may not necessarily be quantified as financial

## Outline Implementation Plan 
- activities such as marketing, promotion, and operation and maintenance infrastructures have to be considered
	- one consideration here is if the project can be outsourced vs. creating it in-house
- this section also includes details about implementation.
- key milestones/decision points

## Costs 
- expected costs associated with project planning
- there will be some uncertainty about the costs but, especially if details about requirements have not been worked out yet

## The Financial Case
- analysis on income and cost revolving around this project 

## Risks 
- costs and benefits will be speculative at this stage, and this section on risks should take this into account
- similarly to how there are project and business objectives
	- there are also project and business risks 
		- threats to successful project execution (project risk)
		- vs. relating to factors that threaten the benefits of the developed project (business risk)

# 2.3 Project Portfolio Management 
- portfolio project management - provided overview of all projects that are organization is undertaking or considering
- prioritizes resource allocation to projects
- decides if new projects are to be made and if existing ones are to be dropped
- concerns:
	- identifying which project proposals are worth implementing
	- assessing amount of risk of failure involved in a project
	- deciding on how to share limited resources (staff time, finance, etc.) between projects
		- a problem could be that there are too many projects started given the available resources
	- being aware of dependencies between projects
		- especially when many projects need to be complete for the organization to get all the benefits
	- ensuring that new projects are not duplicates
	- ensuring that necessary developments have not been missed
- Three aspects of project portfolio management: portfolio definition, portfolio management, portfolio optimization.
## Project Portfolio Definition 
- should record details about all projects
- a problem for organizations is that the project can fall into one of two categories:
	- new product developments (NPD): project deliverable is a product, sold to customers
	- renewal project: improves the way the organization operates
- the distinction is not always super clear
- NPD is usually more frequent in companies that have a continuous development of new goods and services
- renewal less common, so more risk because less experience on these types of projects
- NPD projects are generally easier to fund because of the clear relationship between developing it and income that will come after
- both types of projects use the same pool of resources (including finance)

## Project Portfolio Management 
- once portfolio is established, more detail about costs can be found
- value that manager hope that will be made by the project is also now calculated
- performance of projects and performance metrics are defined
- this information can be the basis of new projects


## Project Portfolio Optimization 
- performance of portfolio tracked by higher level manager on regular basis
- some projects could be very profitable but just as risky 
	- example: e-commerce website: sales may not be as high as they hoped because competitors reduce prices
- other projects have smaller benefits, such as those cutting costs by automating processes, but have fewer risks. the portfolio ought to have a carefully thought-out balance between the two types of projects

## Some problems with project portfolio management 
- important role of project portfolio management is sharing resources between projects
	- choosing a staff member who seemingly works full-time on paper, but only half that time is used developing the project, the other half can also be used for something else in their job (they are not going to be working on this project full time, even though they are a full-time employee at the company)
- official project portfolio might not represent the organization's activity if some projects are not included. a formal decision must be made that only projects over a certain level of cost will be on the portfolio
- "below the line" projects could sometimes consume more staff effort than the 'official projects' (from above). it can be argued that all projects should be included in the official portfolio
- advantage is that tasks can be broken down into small ones
	- gives developers satisfaction that they are completing work upon a user's direct request
	- thus, when allocating resource to a project, a margin should be set to allow managers some judgement in non-planned work

# 2.4 Evaluation of Individual Projects
- looking at how an individual project may be assessed 

## Technical Assessment 
- evaluating whether required functionality can be achieved with current technologies that we can use
- organizational policy likely to limit some technical solutions that are considered

### Cost-Benefit Analysis 
- even when benefits exceed costs, that does not necessarily mean that the proposed project is the best out of all options
- not all projects can be taken at any time, in any case, the most valuable projects should get the most resources
- this analysis has two steps: 
	- identifying all costs and benefits of carrying out the project and operating it after
	- expressing these costs and benefits using common units
		- we must express each cost and benefit - and the net benefit which is the difference between the two (in monetary value)
- most directed costs are easy to quantify and money, categorized as:
	- development costs: includes staff costs
	- setup costs: cost of putting system into place, including new hardware that may be needed for it to work, including cost of file conversion, recruitment and staff training
	- operational costs: operating the system after installation

### Cash Flow Forecasting
 - producing a cash flow forecast which indicates when expenses and incomes will take place
 - need to spend money during development
	 - some expenses cannot wait till the income is received (you must pay it even before the product is developed)
 - need to know that we can fund the development from company's own resources or by borrowing 
 - forecast of expenditures are needed (payment of salaries, or any expected income)
 - accurate cash forecasting is hard, done early in project's life, and many items that are estimated (mostly the benefits of using a specific software) will only be found after a few years of development
 ![[Pasted image 20240221195033.png]]
 - when guessing future cash flows, inflation is generally ignored
 - forecasts of inflation are very uncertain
 - if expenses are increased due to inflation, it is more than likely that income will be increased just as much because of it

# 2.5 Cost-Benefit Evaluation Techniques 
- this chart provides the cash flows of four projects. these amounts are taken at the end of the year
- for short term projects, these cash amounts can be taken in smaller intervals
![[Pasted image 20240221195354.png]]
## Net Profit
- difference between total costs and total income over life of project
- project 2 in the above table has the highest profit (but also a large investment)
	- all projects contain an element of risk and we may not want to risk 1 million in a project that is generally going to be more risky than another that is not
- simple net profits do not take into account timing of the cash flows
	- project 1: the bulk of the income happens later in the life of it

## Payback Period 
- time taken to pay back or break even with the initial investment 
- project with the shortest payback period will be chosen on the basis that an organization wishes to minimize the time that a project is "in debt"
- payback period is generally easy to calculate, and is not sensitive to small forecasting errors

## Return on Investment 
- ROI, also known as accounting rate of return (ARR), gives way of comparing net profitability with the required investment 
- $\text{ROI = }\frac{\text{average annual profit}}{\text{total investment}} * 100$
- for Project 1 above, net profit is 50000, and the total investment is 100000. ROI is then:
$\text{ROI = } \frac{50000/5}{100000}*100 = 10\%$

- two big disadvantages 
	- takes no account of timing
	- rate of return bears no relationship with interest rates offered or charged (related to no timing taken into account)

## Net Present Value 
- takes into account profitability of project and timing of cash flows
- based on view that getting $100 today is better than having to wait a year to get it
	- for example: we could invest that 100 and then have 100 + interest in a year's time
	- if we say present value is 100, it could be 93 in a year's time. getting money now is better than getting money later
- the present value of any future cash flow is obtained using this formula:
$\text{Present Value = } \frac{\text{ value in year t}}{(1+r)^t}$
- r is discount rate, t is number of years into future that cash flow occurs
	- discount rate is just the amount of money that is going to be lost if you wait a year
	- example: if you have $100 dollar, with a discount rate of 10%, you will have about $91 dollars after a year
		- if you received $91 now, and you put it in a bank with an interest of 10%, you will have $100 in a year
- easier: present value of a cash flow could be calculated by multiplying cash flow table by appropriate discount factor
	- net present value is found by discounting each cash flow (negative and positive), and summing discounted values. initial investment is not discounted though
![[Pasted image 20240221201123.png]]
### Example:
- assuming 10% discount rate, the NPV for project  would be calculated as in Table 2.3. The net prsent for project 1, using a 10% discount rate would be $618. Using a 10% discount rate, calculate the net present values for project 2
![[Pasted image 20240221201737.png]]
- the 618 is found by doing:
$9091 + 8264 + 7513 + 13660 + 62090 - 100000 = -618$

## Internal Rate of Return 
- used to compare profitability between two or more projects
- but not able to compare profitability of project with other forms of investment 
- internal rate of return (IRR) is discount rate that would result in NPV = 0 for the project
- used to compare different investment opportunities

# 2.6 Risk Evaluation 
- every project has risk.
- project risks: prevent project from being completed successfully
- business risk: delivered products are not profitable
- mostly will focus on business risk 

## Risk Identification and Ranking 
- construct a project risk matrix which uses a checklist of risks and classifying risks according to their relative importance and likelihood.
- less concerned with something that is very unlikely but more serious vs. something is less serious but certain to happen
![[Pasted image 20240221202503.png]]

## Risk and Net Present Value 
- for a project that is relatively risky, it is common to use a higher discount rate to calculate net present value
- this higher discount rate might be 2% more for a reasonably safe project or 5% for a fairly risky one.
- projects may be categorized as high, medium, low risk using scoring method and risk premiums designated for each category.

## Cost Benefit Analysis 
- consider each possible outcome and estimate it's probability of happening
- rather than single cash flow forecast for a project, we will have a a few cash flow forecasts, and each will have its own associated probability of occurring. value of the project is then obtained by summing the cost or benefit of each possible outcome, weighed by corresponding probability.
- this is usually used for larger projects (such as buildings or creating a highway)
	- where more variables are present
- for a single major project, this approach of "averaging" the negative and positive outcomes of scenarios does not take full account of "worst-case scenarios".\
- because of this, in projects where profitability is of main concern, it is better to use something that will take into account how the successful projects will offset the less successful ones (in the context of portfolio analysis)

## Risk Profile Analysis
- involves taking the parameters that affect project cost or benefits, and get an idea of how sensitive the project's profitability is to each factor
- might vary one of our original estimates by plus or minus 5%, and recalculate expected costs and benefits for the project
- by repeating this, we can get an idea of the sensitivity of each project to each factor
- by looking at sensitivity analysis, we can identify factors that are most important to a successful project

## Using Decision Trees
- decisions of whether a risk is important or not can lead to changes in future options
- you can use decision trees to check this.
- the cost of each outcome is going to be the sum of the value at each possible outcome (for the sake of these notes, I will call them nodes), multiplied by its probability of occurrence.
![[Pasted image 20240221203742.png]]
- with this example, the expected value of extending the system is $40000 = (75000 * 0.8 - 100000 * 0.2)$
- in this example, the expected value of replacement is going to be $10000 = (250000 * 0.2 - 50000 * 0.8)$


# 2.7 Programme Management 
- there is risk to every project
- even projects that have financial benefits, the size of the benefits is unknown at the beginning
- programme definition *"a group of projects that are managed in a coordinated way to gain benefits that would not be possible were the projects to be managed independently"* from D.C Ferns
- many different programmes: 

## Business Cycle Programmes
- projects that an organization takes within a particular planning cycle 

## Strategic Programmes 
- more than one project can implement a single strategy
- example: merging two organization's computer systems could require several projects, where each one deals with a particular application area. each activity could be treated as its own project, but would be coordinated as a program

## Infrastructure Programmes
- organizations that many departments, each which carry out self-contained activities
- example: one department could be responsible for maintaining highways, while another would be responsible for education, etc.
- all of these activities need their own database and information systems
- the central information and communication technology would have be used to maintain this infrastructure (including networks, workstations, and servers for these applications to run on)
- infrastructure programme refers to the activities of identifying a common information and communications technology (ICT) infrastructure and its maintenance/implementation

## Research and Development Programmes 
- some companies develop and research new things, that generally vary in terms of risk
- some developments are relatively safe, which results in a product that is not very different from something already on the market
- risky projects, if successful, can be something completely new
- a successful portfolio would need to be a mixture of "safe projects" with relatively low returns and some riskier projects that might fail, but if successful then would generate a lot of profit which would offset the cost of the failures

## Innovative Partnerships 
- companies sometimes come together and work on new technologies in a "pre-competitive" stage
- different projects in different organizations need to be coordinated and might be done as a programme

# 2.8 Managing the Allocation of Resources within Programmes 
- typically an information and communications technology department will have pools of particular types of expertise, such as software developers, database designers, etc.
	- these people might be called up to participate in a number of concurrent projects
- programme managers will have concerns about the use of specialist staff, while project managers usually don't care
	- example: a project manager requires a competent systems analysis. whoever fills that spot doesn't matter, as long as the job gets done
- programme manager vs. project manager
	- programme manager does more than one project at a time, while a project manager only does one project at a time 
	- programme manager has a personal relationship with skilled resources, and project managers have impersonal relationship with resource types
	- programme manger needs to maximize the utilization of resources, while project managers need to minimize the demand for resources

- when a project is planned, when allocating resources, programme management is involved
- some activities might have to be delayed until technical staff are freed from work
- when these technical staff are employed full time, you would want to avoid having short periods of a lot of work with longer periods of doing nothing/minimal work
- when a project is executed, activities could take longer than planned (or even less time sometimes)
- so programme management is required to monitor the progress of projects and use of resources

# 2.9 Strategic Programme Management 
- different form of programme management: where portfolio of projects all contribute to common objective
	- example: business carries out maintenance for clients. customer's experience with this organization is inconsistent. employee who records customer's requirements is different from the people who carry out the maintenance. often, customer has to explain to one company employee something that they explained to another in the past. business objective may be to present a consistent and uniform from to the client
	- this objective may require changes to number of different systems which have until this point, been self-contained.
- these types of programmes are more often used by large organizations that have a complex structure

# 2.10 Creating a Programme
## The Programme Mandate 
- formal document by the OGC that includes :
	- the new services/capabilities the program should deliver 
	- how the organization will be improved with these changes
	- how programme fits with corporate goals
- at this point, the programme director has to be given initial leadership for the programme. this person should have someone who has a prominent position in the organization

## The Programme Brief 
- outlines the business case for the programme. has sections: 
	- preliminary vision statement which describes the new capacity that organization seeks - "preliminary" because it will be elaborated later
	- benefits that the program should create (when they are likely to happen and how they might be measured)
	- risks and issues
	- estimated costs, timescales and efforts

## The Vision Statement 
- programme brief should given enough information to stakeholders to decide whether or not a more detailed description of the programme is needed
- a group is created and a programme manager with day-to-day responsibility for the program would be appointed
- this group takes the vision statement from the project brief and expands it.
	- if estimates for cost, performance and service benefits cannot be measured, there should be an indication of how they might be measured

## The Blueprint 
- contains:
	- business models outlining new process required
	- organizational structure - includes members of staff and how their skills will be used
	- information systems, equipment, non-staff resources that are needed
	- data and information requirements
	- costs, performance, and service level requirements
- blueprint is supported by "benefit profiles" which estimate the expected benefits with implementing the programme. 
- program should deliver tangible benefits
- being provided with a capability does not necessarily mean it will be used to get the benefits that are mentioned

- major risk for those whose work is affected by the programme will not be drawn into programme effectively
	- stakeholder map is used to identify groups of people with an interest in the project and it's outcomes, as well as their particular interests could be drawn up. could be used to write a *communications strategy* and *plan* to show how the appropriate information flows between stakeholders and can be set up and maintained



# 2.11 Aids to Programme Management
## Dependency Diagrams
- shows physical and technical dependencies between projects
	- example: project to relocate staff from one building to another cannot start until project to construct a new building is done

## Delivery Planning 
- needs tranches of projects
- trach is a group of projects that will deliver their products as one step in the programme
- projects in a tranche should combine to create a new set of benefits for the client. 


# 2.12 Some Reservations about Programme Management 
- THIS IS NOT IN THE SLIDES SO IM GOING TO LEAVE IT 

# 2.13 Benefits Management 
- providing capability does not necessarily mean capability will be used to deliver the planned benefits
- benefits management encompasses the identification, optimization, and tracking of the expected benefits from a business change in order to ensure that they are actually received
- you must:
	- define expected benefits from programme
	- analyze the balance between costs and benefits
	- plan how benefits will be achieved and measured
	- allocate responsibilities for the successful delivery of benefits 
	- monitor realization of benefits
- benefits can be of many types: 
	- mandatory compliance
	- quality of service
	- productivity
	- more motivated work force
	- internal management benefits
	- risk reduction
	- economy
	- revenue enhancement/acceleration
	- strategic fit

## Quantifying Benefits 
- benefits can be
	- quantified and valued e.g. a reduction of X staffing saving some amount of money (Y)
	- quantified but not valued e.g. decrease in the number of customer complaints
	- identifiable but not easily quantified e.g. public approval of organization in the locality where it is based
- some activities may also have dis-benefits
	- example: increased sales might mean that more money may have to be spent on overtime workers

THE REST OF THIS SUB-CHAPTER IS NOT COVERED IN LECTURE SLIDES, I WILL NOT LOOK AT THEM


# Remember!
- a project may fail, not necessarily because of poor management, but because it shouldn't have been started in the first place
- project may make a profit, but it may be possible to do something else that makes even more profit
- a real problem is that it is often not possible to express benefits in accurate financial terms
- projects with the highest potential returns are often the most risky

# Conclusion and Important Points
 - projects are evaluated on strategic, technical, and economic grounds
 - sometimes projects are not justifiable on their own, but in the grand scheme of things the project can work with the organization's strategy 
 - not all benefits can be quantified with money values
 - economic assessment involves identification of costs and income over the life of the system
	 - includes development and operation, and checking that the total values of benefits is higher than that of the costs
 - money received in the future is worth less than the same money in hand now, which can be used to invest and get some amount more
 - the uncertainty around estimates of future returns lowers their real measured value now
 - discounted cash flow techniques may be used to evaluate the present value of cash flows taking account of interest rates and uncertainty
 - cost-benefit analysis techniques and decision trees provide tools for evaluating expected outcomes and choosing between strategies.
