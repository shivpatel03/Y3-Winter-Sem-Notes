The image contains a table titled "Table 1: Software Metrics," which lists different types of metrics used in software development and testing. Here are brief definitions of some of the metrics listed:

1. **Cyclomatic Complexity**: Measures the number of linearly independent paths through a program's source code. This metric helps in understanding the complexity of a program. A higher number indicates more complex code, which may be more difficult to test and maintain.

2. **Average Cyclomatic Complexity**: This is the mean value of the cyclomatic complexity across various modules or functions within the software. It gives a general idea of the overall complexity of the software.

3. **Modified Cyclomatic Complexity**: A variation of the standard cyclomatic complexity, which may consider certain structures in the code differently, possibly to align with modern programming practices or specific project requirements.

4. **Strict Cyclomatic Complexity**: This might be a measure that does not consider certain structures that normally reduce cyclomatic complexity, such as short-circuit operators.

5. **Essential Cyclomatic Complexity**: This metric measures the complexity that remains after the structured programming constructs are removed. It can indicate the amount of unstructured complexity in the code.

6. **Average Number of Lines of Code (Include Inactive)**: This metric provides an average count of all lines of code, including those that are not active, such as commented code. It gives an insight into the potential size of the codebase.

7. **Lines with Comments (Include Inactive)**: This counts the number of lines that contain comments, providing insight into the documentation and readability of the code.

8. **Blank Lines of Code**: Counts the number of empty lines in the code. While not directly related to functionality, this can affect readability and maintainability.

9. **Executable Statements**: The number of lines in the code that are actually executable commands. This helps in understanding how much of the code is performing actions as opposed to declarations or comments.

10. **Declarative Statements**: These are lines of code that declare variables, constants, types, etc. Understanding the ratio of declarative statements to executable statements can give insight into the nature of the codebase.

11. **Classes, Function (Object Oriented)**: This refers to the count of classes and functions within object-oriented programming. This metric can be used to understand the complexity and structure of an object-oriented codebase.

In test planning, these metrics can be used to:

- Estimate the effort required for testing by understanding the complexity of the code.
- Identify high-risk areas where more testing may be needed, such as parts of the code with high cyclomatic complexity.
- Plan for code reviews and maintenance activities by evaluating the amount of commented and inactive code.
- Ensure code quality by checking the balance between different types of statements.
- Allocate resources effectively by understanding the size and structure of the codebase through metrics like the number of classes and functions. 

These metrics provide quantitative data that can inform decisions about where to focus testing efforts, how to allocate resources, and what areas might need refactoring for better maintainability and testability.
