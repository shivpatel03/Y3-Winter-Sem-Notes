# Microeconomics, Microeconomics, and Bank of Canada

# Microeconomics vs Macroeconomics
- Microeconomics:
	- Go to business school or take a job?
	- What determines the salary offered by Citibank to John Smith, a new Columbia MBA
	- What determines the cost to a university or college offering a new course
	- What government policies should be adopted to make it easier for low-income students to addend post-secondary?
	- What determines whether Citibank opens a new office in Shanghai?
- Macroeconomics
	- how many people are employed in the economy as a whole? 
	- What determines the overall salary levels paid to workers in a given year? 
	- What determines the overall level of prices in the economy as a whole
	- What government policies should be adopted to promote full employment and growth in the economy as a whole?
	- What determines the overall trade in goods, services and financial assets between the US and the rest of the world? 

- Microeconomics focuses on how decisions are made by individuals and firms, and the consequences of these decisions
- Macroeconomics examines the aggregate behavior of the economy (i.e. how the actions of all individuals and firms in the economy interact to produce a particular level of economic performance as a whole)

# Individual Choice: The Core of Economics
- a resource is anything that can be used to produce something else.
	- land, labor, physical capital, human capital
- resources are scarce - the quantity available isn't large enough to satisfy all productive uses
	- Petroleum, lumber, intelligence 
- Individual choice - the decision by an individual about what to do, which involves a decision about what not to do
- principles behind the individual choices include the following
	- resources are scarce
	- the real cost of something is what you must give up to get it
	- "how much" is a decision at the margin
	- people usually take advantage of opportunities to make themselves better off

# Supply, Demand, and Equilibrium
- The law of demand: the quantity purchased varies inversely with price. In other words, the higher the price, the lower the quantity demanded
- law of supply states that as the price of an item goes up, suppliers will attempt to maximize their profits by increasing the number of items for sale
- Focuses on supply and demand as the driving forces behind production, pricing, and consumption of goods and services
- consumers and producers of a good vary the price and quantity of the good traded between them until price hits an
- Equilibrium point: total quantity of goods demanded = total quantity of good supplied

# Supply/Demand Curves
- as the price of an item goes up, suppliers will attempt to maximize their profits by increasing the number of items for sale
- when we have a shortage in supply, the buyers will pay a higher price, and producers will start 
	- less available -> buyers pay a premium for a more "rare" product
- when producers make too much, they will have a surplus as demand goes down
	- too available -> when people stop wanting it as much, they will be left with more excess product


# Price Elasticity of Demand
- an economic measure of the change in the quantity demanded or purchased of a product in relation to it's price change

`Price Elasticity of Demaond = (%change in quantity demanded)/(%change in price)`
- if `|Price Elasticity of Demand|` < 1 -> inelastic
- if `|Price Elasticity of Demand` > 1 -> elastic

# Price Elasticity of Supply
- An economic measure of the responsiveness to the supply of a good or service after a change in its market price
- supply will increase when price rises
- supply will decrease when the price drops
`Price Elasticity of Supply = (%change of quantity supplied)/(%change in price)`
- if `|Price Elasticity of Supply|` < 1 -> inelastic 
- if `|Price Elasticity of Supply|` > 1 -> elastic


# Incentives and Behaviors
- focuses on situations that motivate individuals or firms to behave in a certain way
- positive incentives: 
	- example: rewards and payments, social status, etc.
- disincentives or negative incentive
	- fines, taxes
- incentives could backfire
	- paying people to donate blood
	- fining people if they are late to pick up their children from day-care

# Utility Theory
- buyers choose to buy stuff that will maximize their "utility", depending on how much money have have available to spend
	- usefulness, worth, values, benefit, satisfaction/happiness

# Law of Increasing Returns vs. Law of Diminishing Returns
- increasing returns:
	- if all inputs are increased, economies of scale will increase total productivity
- diminishing returns: 
	- if there is a factor K that remains constant, increasing L or R would increase production until we reach a limit


# Macroeconomics - Main Concepts 
- circular flow of income
- gross domestic product
- measuring growth
- unemployment
- prices and inflation
- aggregate demand and supply
- labor productivity
- recessions and expansions
- macroeconomic policies

## Circular Flow of Income 
- Households
	- supply resources to the market; earn income 
	- demand goods and services from market, spend income 
- Firms
	- demand resources to produce goods and services; payment for resources
	- supply goods and services in market, earn revenue

# Macro vs. Microeconomics
- in macroeconomics, the behavior of the the whole macroeconomy is greater than the sum of individual actions and market outcomes
	- example: when families and businesses get worried about harder economic times, they start cutting their costs
	- this reduction in spending depresses the economy as consumers spend less and business react by laying off workers
	- so families and businesses may end up worse off than if they hadn't tried to act responsibly and cut their spending

# Measuring Economic Activity 
- Measured in Gross Domestic Product (GDP)
	- market value of the final goods and services produced in a country during a given period

# Macroeconomics - Theory and Policy
- in a self-regulating economy, problems such as unemployment are resolved without government intervention, through the working of the invisible hand
- according the Keynesian economics, economic slumps are caused by inadequate spending and they can be mitigated by the government intervention
- monetary policy uses changes in the quality of money to alter interest rates and affect overall spending
- fiscal policy uses changes in government spending and taxes to affect overall spending

# The Business Cycle 
- short-run alternation between economic downturns and upturns 
- depression is a very deed a long downturn
- recessions are periods of downturns when output of employment are failing
- expansions (also called recoveries), are periods of economic upturns when the output and employment are rising
- the point at which the economy turns from expansion to recession is the **business-cycle peak**
	- expansion is good, recession is bad
	- good to bad
	- "the best it's gonna get" (not actually, just called a peak for that reason though, it's the top)
- the point at which the economy turns from recession to expansion is a **business-cycle trough**
	- bad to good
	- (this is the bottom, "the worst it's going to get")

# Recessions and Expansions 
- a 'vicious cycle' can be something like the following
	- income falls -> sales fall -> production falls -> employment falls -> income falls -> repeat (continue)
- a 'virtuous cycle' can be something like:
	- income rises -> sales rise -> production rises -> employment rises -> income rises -> repeat (continue)


# Taming the Business Cycle 
- Policy efforts undertaken to reduce how bad the recession is are called "stabilization policy"
- one type of stabilization policy is "monetary policy": changes in the quantity of money or the interest rate
- the second type is "fiscal policy": changes in tax policy or government spending, or both

# Central Banks 
- responsible for overseeing the monetary system and policy for a nation, regulating money supply, setting interest rates
- they use the monetary policy -> ease or tighten money supply and availability of credit
- set requirements for the banking industry, such as amount of cash reserves banks must maintain
- lender of last resort to troubled financial institutions or even governments
- legal monopoly status (the main differentiating factor from commercial banks), which gives privilege to issue banknotes and cash. private commercial banks are only allowed to issue demand liabilities (such as checking deposits)

# Bank of Canada - Main areas of responsibility
- nation's central bank. main role is to "promote the economic and financial welfare of Canada"
	- monetary policy: tries to keep inflation low and stable using their policy framework
	- financial system: promotes safe, sound, efficient financial systems in Canada
	- currency: designs, issues, distributes Canada's bank notes
	- funds management: the "fiscal agent" for government of Canada, managing public debt programs
	- retail payment supervision: bank will be responsible for supervising payment service providers
