# Economic Decisions, Economic Costs, and Cost Estimating 

- problems can be sorted into groups by levels of difficulty
	- simple problems
		- do not require much time or effort
	- intermediate problems
		- primarily economic
	- complex
		- mix of economic, political, and social/ethical problems

## The Role of Engineering Economic Analysis
- Engineering economics analysis is most suitable for intermediate problems and economic aspects of complex problems
- these problems should
	- be important enough to require this type of effort
	- be not easily worked out in your head
	- contain economic aspects that are important in making the decision

# Decision Making Process
1. Recognize the problem - once we are aware of the problem, solve it as best as we can
2. define the goal or objective - the goal can be big, an objective can be narrow and specific
3. assemble relevant data - get information through research or
4. identify feasible alternatives
5. select the criteria to determine the best alternative
6. construct a model
7. predict the outcomes of consequences for each alternative
8. choose the best alternative
9. audit the results

- Recognize the problem: 
	- once we know the problem, try to solve it
- define the goal or objective
	- goal can be big, objective can be narrow and specific (small)
- assemble relevant data
	- obtain information through market research or other data
	- important source of information is the firm's own accounting system
	- time horizon of the problem must be assembled
	- financial costs and benefits
- identify feasible alternatives
	- unless the best alternative is already considered, the result will always be less than ideal
	- two types of alternatives are sometimes ignored
		- "do nothing" alternative
		- unglamorous alternative
	- ensure that all alternatives have been listed
	- impractical alternatives may lead to a better possibility
- select the criteria for determining the best alternative
	- we must define what we mean by "best"
	- there must at last one criterion, or a set of criteria, to evaluate which alternative is best
- construct a model
	- the objective, relevant data, feasible alternatives, and selection standards must be merged
		- model building
	- in economic decision making, the model is usually mathematical
- predict the outcomes for each alternative
	- the model and dat that are used to predict the outcomes of each feasible alternative
	- to choose the best alternative, the outcomes for each alternative must be stated in a comparable way
	- consequences are usually evaluated in monetary terms
	- common mistake: assume for longer-term problems that the "do nothing" alternative is chosen
- choose the best alternative
	- the right choice is the one that meets the criteria the best
		- numerical and intangible consequences are checked too
- audit the results
	- audit of the results is a comparison of what happened against the predictions
	- helps keep project on track
	- helps future estimates and assumptions
	- provides an incentive to give accurate estimates


# Decision-Making: Problem 1
- company is considering two machines. both machines provide the same output and benefits:
	- machine 1 costs $300,000 to purchase and requires four employees to operate. The cost of maintenance of Machine 1 is $100,000 and $50,000 per employee over the machine's lifetime
	- machine 2 costs $500,000 to purchase and requires two employees to operate. The machine is maintenance free and costs $40,000 per employee over the machine's lifetime
- which machine should the company purchase?


## Solution: 
- outputs are fixed, therefore minimize cost
- costs = purchase price + maintenance + employee(s) cost
- machine 1: cost = $300,000 + $100,000 + 4($50,000) = $600,000
- machine 2: cost = $500,000 + $0 + 2($40,000) = $580,000
- since the overall cost is lower for machine 2 is lower, choose machine 2


# Decision-Making: Problem 2
- John is an auto mechanic, and suddenly inherits a sum of $1,000,000 after his parents died in a crash. He makes $15 an hour and works about 50 hours a week for 52 weeks a year (10-hour overtime per week). He gets two weeks of paid vacation. The overtime wage is at 1.5x the regular wage.
- he would like to get an income from his inheritance equivalent to his job such that he can quit his job. He found that he could invest the money safely at an interest rate for 5% year for the rest of his life
- will John make enough money with his investments to quit his job?

## Solution: 
- Yearly earnings: 15(40)(52) + 15(1.5)(10)(52) = $42,900
- Investments income: 0.05(1,000,000) = $50,000
- Since John will make more money from his investment, he should quit his job


# Ethics
- Describes as distinguishing right and wrong decisions
	- establishing beliefs and moral obligations
	- defining values and fairness
	- determining duties and guidelines for conduct
- Ethical decision-making requires:
	- an understanding of the context behind the problem
	- possible choices and the outcomes of each choice


# Ethical Dimensions in Engineering Decision-Making
- in Canada, provincial and territorial associations of professional engineers are responsible for the regulation of the practice of engineering 
	- Engineers Canada
- For all engineers, difficulties arise when their actions are contrary to these written or internal codes

# The Environment we Live In
- the decision maker must also ask who incurs the cost for the project and who receives the benefits
- ethical issues can be particularly difficult because there are often stakeholders that have opposing views

# Safety and Cost 
- trade-offs: 
	- is it safe enough? 
	- is it "too safe" to the point where it's too expensive? 

# Emerging Issues and "Solutions"
- governments have started to prevent, limit, and expose financial wrongdoing within corporations
- globalization is and important part of ethical discussions
	- different countries have different ethical expectations

# Importance of Ethics In Engineering and Engineering Economy
- though engineers and firms try to act ethically, sometimes mistakes are made
- it is the engineer's duty to speak out to protect the safety of the public
- integrity of the foundation for long-term career success

# Engineering Decision Making for Current Costs
- if a decision is one where the results are known by a short period of time, it can be determined by:
	- adding up costs and benefits where alternatives
	- using this, one can determine the best alternative

- Example (tile for plant floor - fixed output)
	- 1000 m^2
	- Tile A costs
		- purchase $52/m^2; installation is 37000
	- Tile B costs
		- purchase $63/m^2; installation is 28000
	- select tile A to minimize cost for a fixed output

# Engineering Costs
- Fixed:
	- constant unchanging costs
	- something like a $1000 one-time
- variable:
	- depends on the level of output or activity
	- something like $2.5/unit
- marginal:
	- variable cost for one more unit
- average:
	- total cost divided by the number of units
- break-even point: the of activity at which the total cost of a product is equal to the revenue generated
- profit region: values that are greater than the break-even point
- loss region: values that are smaller than the break-even point

## Problem
- A company operates a summer camp. The following cost data for a 12-week summer camp is:
	- Charge per camper = $400/week -> this is what you are getting for each camper
	- Variable cost per camper = $220/week -> this is what it costs the company for each camper
	- Fixed cost = $240,000 per summer season
	- Capacity per week = 200 campers
- Determine;
	- Total number of campers to break even during the season
		- when total cost = revenue
		- $200 + 220(12 weeks)**X** = 400(12 weeks)**X**, where X is the number of campers
		- solving for X -> X=111 campers
	- profit if the camp is operated at 90% capacity
		- number of campers = 0.9(200 campers) = 180
		- `profit = (180 campers)($400 being paid to us)(12 weeks) - ($240,000 + (180 campers)(12 weeks)($220))`
		- $188,800
		- we just did the amount of money that is being given to us - the amount of money that we are paying for these campers
	- the additional profit that can be made if a discount of $100 per week is given for another 10 campers
		- `10(12)(400-100) - 10(12)(220) = $9600`
		- amount of money that we get from these 10 campers - the amount of money that we pay for these campers
- Sunk costs
	- money already spent because of a past decision
	- should be disregarded in engineering economic analysis
- opportunity costs
	- the cost that comes with using a resource for an alternate task
	- "an opportunity cost is the benefit that is forgone by engaging a business resource in a chosen activity instead of engaging that same resource in a forgone activity"
- recurring and non-recurring costs
	- recurring: cost that reoccurs at regular intervals
	- non-recurring: one-of-a-kind cost that reoccurs at irregular intervals
- incremental costs
	- costs differences between alternatives
- Cash costs vs Book costs
	- Cash costs: requires a cash transaction out of one person's pocket into the pocket of someone else
	- Book costs:
		- recorded but not transactions
			- does not represent cash flow, so not included in engineering economics analysis
- life-cycle costs
	- designing products, goods, and services with a full and explicit recognition of the associated costs over their life cycles
	- two concepts;
		- the later the design change is made, the higher the cost
		- decisions made early in the life cycle tend to "lock in" costs that will be incurred later

# Cost Estimating 
- Rough estimates
	- quick and easy, high level estimates and accuracy varies (from -30% to +60%)
- Budget estimates
	- used for budgeting projects where the accuracy is better than a rough estimate to the extra effort used to make a determination (accuracy of -15% to 20%)
- Detailed estimates
	- estimates made from detailed designs using quantitative models and vendor quotes (accuracy of -3% to +5%)

- Difficulties in estimation
	- One-of-a-kind estimation
		- first run projects and projects that have never been done before
	- Time and effort available
		- human resources and time available for making estimates

# Estimating Models 
- Per-unit model
	- uses a per-unit factor (example: cost per square foot)
- Segmenting model
	- "divide and conquer" approach
	- individual and component estimates are added together
- Cost indexing 
	- historical change in costs as a ration relationship
- Power-sizing model
	- used to "scale up" or "scale down" known costs
- Triangulation
	- Approaching the estimate using different sources of data or different quantitative models to confirm the value initially calculated
- Improvement and the Learning Curve
	- a percentage or rate at which output is increased due to repetition
	- `T_n = T_initial * N^b`
	- where: 
		- `T_n` = time required for Nth unit of production
		- `T_initial` = time required for first unit production
		- `N` = number of completed units
		- `b` = learning curve exponent
			- `b = (log(learning curve expressed as decimal))/(log(2.0))`
- The Learning Curve: problem
	- In a complex assembly operation, it is found that the learning curve rate is 70%. The standard time of 3 minutes per assembly is reached after the 110th unit
		- calculate the time required for the very first unit
		- Calculate the time required for the 200th unit
	- Calculate the time required for the very first unit
		- `Tn = Tinitial * N^b`
		- `b = log(0.7)/log(0.2)`
		- `T_110` = 3 minutes (time it takes to make the 110th unit)
		- `N` = 110
		- solve for `T_initial`
		- 3 = T1 x 110^(log0.7/log0.2)
			- = 33.70 minutes
	- Calculate the time it takes to make the 200th unit
		- T200 = (33.70) x 200^(log0.7/log0.2)
		- = 2.21 minutes

# Estimating Benefits 
- economic analysis required analyzing the benefits as well as the costs
- many of the same methods that can be used to calculate costs are also used to calculate benefits
- benefits are usually in the future, which make them harder to estimate

# Cash Flow Diagrams 
- Drawing a cash flow diagram:
	- show when all cash flows occur

- Categories of cash flow diagrams
	- first cost: expense of building or of buying and installing
	- operations and maintenance: annual expense such as electricity, labor, and minor repairs 
	- salvage value: receipt at project termination for sale or transfer of the equipment (can be a salvage cost)
	- revenues: annual receipts due to sale of products or services
	- overhaul: major capital expenditure that occurs during the life of an asset
	-
